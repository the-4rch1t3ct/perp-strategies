SMALL-CAP FAIRNESS REPORT (after smooth OI + relative threshold)
======================================================================
Generated after API restart with:
  - Smooth relative strength (no hard $1M OI cutoff; curve from $50k–$10M)
  - Hybrid weights 20% base / 80% relative
  - Dynamic heatmap OI floor: max($25k, 2% of symbol total OI)

Totals: 45 symbols, 40 with strength≥0.5, 0 with active signal.

Notes:
  - Str≥0.5: symbols whose best cluster strength meets min_strength (0.50).
  - Non-NEUTRAL: symbols with LONG/SHORT signal (after RR/trend/TP filters).
  - Before the change: all symbols with OI < $1M had relative_strength=0, so
    hybrid strength was only 20% of base (market share) and almost none
    reached 0.50. Now 5 of 6 small-cap symbols reach Str≥0.5.

Small-cap (<$1M OI) symbols and strength:
  ALGOUSDT       str=0.60  dir=NEUTRAL  OI≈$981k
  COMPUSDT       str=0.60  dir=NEUTRAL  OI≈$653k
  GMXUSDT        str=0.50  dir=NEUTRAL  OI≈$289k
  SNXUSDT        str=0.50  dir=NEUTRAL  OI≈$460k
  SUPERUSDT      str=0.50  dir=NEUTRAL  OI≈$445k
  TNSRUSDT       str=0.40  dir=NEUTRAL  OI≈$162k

(TNSRUSDT remains just below 0.50 at very low OI; others now qualify.)
